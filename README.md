## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a comprehensive, AI-powered Smart Crop Advisory System designed specifically for small and marginal farmers. It will be delivered through a multilingual mobile application and chatbot interface, accessible via smartphones and feature phones with voice support. The system will integrate multiple data sources including soil health records, local weather forecasts, satellite imagery, and historical crop data to provide personalized, real-time recommendations.

Key features include:

Personalized Crop Selection: Based on soil type, moisture levels, and climatic conditions, the system suggests the most suitable crops for each farmer’s land.
Soil Health and Fertilizer Guidance: Using soil test data and crop nutrient requirements, the app recommends optimal fertilizer types and dosages to improve yield while minimizing chemical overuse.
Weather Alerts and Predictive Insights: Real-time weather updates and forecasts help farmers plan irrigation, sowing, and harvesting activities effectively.
Pest and Disease Detection: Farmers can upload images of affected crops; AI-powered image recognition identifies pests or diseases and suggests appropriate control measures.
Market Price Tracking: The app provides up-to-date market prices for various crops, enabling farmers to make informed selling decisions.
Voice and Local Language Support: To overcome literacy and language barriers, the system supports voice commands and responses in multiple regional languages.
Feedback Loop: Continuous data collection on usage and outcomes will help refine the advisory algorithms and improve accuracy over time.
This solution addresses the core challenges faced by small farmers by providing scientific, localized, and easy-to-understand advice, reducing dependency on unreliable sources and guesswork.

## Technical Approach
The system will be developed using a combination of modern technologies:

Frontend: Mobile app developed using React Native for cross-platform compatibility (Android and iOS), with a lightweight chatbot interface accessible via SMS/USSD for feature phone users.
Backend: Cloud-based infrastructure using AWS or Azure to handle data processing, storage, and AI model deployment.
AI and Machine Learning:
Crop recommendation engine using supervised learning models trained on historical crop yield, soil, and weather data.
Image recognition models (CNNs) for pest and disease detection, trained on a large dataset of labeled crop images.
Natural Language Processing (NLP) for multilingual voice and text interaction.
Data Integration: APIs to fetch real-time weather data, soil health databases, and market price feeds.
User Interface: Simple, intuitive UI with voice input/output and visual aids to support low-literacy users.
Implementation Methodology:
Requirement gathering and stakeholder consultation.
Prototype development and pilot testing in selected regions.
Iterative refinement based on user feedback.
Full-scale deployment and continuous monitoring.
Flowcharts and wireframes will be created to map user journeys and system architecture, ensuring clarity and efficiency in development.

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility:
High mobile phone penetration among farmers supports app adoption.
Availability of open data sources (weather, soil, market prices) facilitates integration.
Existing AI models for image recognition and NLP can be adapted to local languages and crops.
Potential Challenges:
Digital literacy and technology adoption barriers among target users.
Variability in internet connectivity in rural areas.
Ensuring accuracy and reliability of AI recommendations.
Data privacy and security concerns.
Mitigation Strategies:
Incorporate voice-based interaction and offline capabilities.
Partner with local extension officers and NGOs for training and support.
Use edge computing to reduce dependency on continuous internet access.
Implement robust data encryption and user consent protocols.
Viability:
Strong government support and alignment with agricultural development goals.
Potential for public-private partnerships with agri-tech startups.
Scalability to other regions and crops after initial deployment.
